title: Cruising Kerala's backwaters
---

The lazying around continues. We moved away from the open sea and onto the backwaters of Kerala---900km of waterways spread along 200km of the Indian shore. Our home for the next two days is a kettuvalam---a houseboat with two bedrooms, a captain, and a cook---with nothing around but water, palm trees and rice fields.

These waterways have for centuries been used as "highways", before any roads were built and cars started moving. To this day parts of the land here are accessible only by water and most of the rice grown here (the region is "Kerala's ricebowl") gets moved via boats.

The kettuvalam are a major tourist attraction here, for locals and foreigners alike. In fact, we heard about them, and were strongly recommended to take one, from our friend in Bengaluru. We're told there's over 1,500 of them floating around here, and in the tourist season most waterways are packed.

Our boat is medium-sized, compared to others we've seen so far. One deck, with two bedrooms for the four of us, plus our own captain to steer it and a cook to cater to our culinary needs. It's all inclusive, with what promises to be excellent Keralan cuisine.

There's air-conditioning at night, so we can sleep, but only during nighttime, when the boat docks somewhere and we connect to mainland current. That's no issue during the day though, when we sit on a covered deck with a very pleasant breeze passing through from the water. There's no WiFi, but the excellent Indian cellular network has a steady 3G/4G signal even out here, in the middle of nowhere, so I can send some photos back home and publish these posts here uninterrupted.

We spend the days cruising the waters. A bit in the open of the Vembanad Lake---the largest lake in Kerala, we were told---which is nothing to write home about, just a vast amount of water with a number of similar houseboats floating around. Most of the time we're in the waterways though. Lined up along their shores are locals' houses, sometimes solitary, most of the time organized into small villages.

These are captivating scenes. I think I shot some two hundred photos with a tele-lens, out of the eight hundred or so total in India so far. Small, colorful cottages, children playing cricket on an improvised local field, women doing the laundry in the river, soaking every piece of clothing then beating it with a loud SMACK! several times against large stones laying on the shore. From afar it looks like a solid workout for the arms and shoulders, it's just a pity that it takes so much time out of their days.

There's a _ton_ of these houseboats here, and we're lucky we made it here outside of the tourist season, when only a handful of them are moving. Otherwise it'd literally be traffic jams on the channels.

Locals happily will cater to the, mostly white but also affluent Indian, tourists on the boats. Along the channels multiple shops, restaurants, cafes are open for business. We stopped in one of the villages, home to a Christian church established there in the 5th century AD, and sided by a number of wood carving shops.

The one shop we entered was making sacred statues to order, mostly for other churches. A crucified Christ was waiting there ready for pickup, another one was in the process of being carved and in a corner was a half-ready statue of... John Paul II, "our" former pope. Their shop offered a number of standard, Indian and Hindu figures, including Ganesh, Vishnu, elephants and others. Prices were quoted in US Dollars---for the convenience of tourists---and obviously credit cards were accepted. I do want to get myself eventually a statue of Vishnu, the Cosmic Dancer, but I know it's most heavily related to Tamil Nadu, our final state of destination, so I'll want to get one right there.

Our crew is very hospitable. Fifteen minutes after we took off from the shore, the cook served us fried bananas. We had a bar of melting chocolate bought back in Kochi, which served as the perfect companion for these. Throughout the cruise he's been serving us a continuous mix of Keralan specialties, with a lot of fish.

The captain doubled as our guide. He speaks decent English, well enough to explain some history and intricacies of culture. He didn't learn it at school though---all they had back when he was a kid was the local Malayam and Hindu, the latter one he all but forgot, since he never gets to use it. No, English he learned on the job, touring westerners like ourselves, with a smile and an outgoing attitude.

Following out houseboat adventure, we'll he heading for our last stop in Kerala---the tea plantations around Munnar. Let's hope we'll actually get there as scheduled, because exactly for the day of our travel, the opposition party of Kerala called for a hartal. It's a local form of protest, much like a general strike, when _everything_ stops. Not even any vehicles are allowed to move on the roads between 6AM and 6PM.

This being the opposition party's call, it's obviously only their supporters who follow. The region we're in with the houseboats isn't affected, being one inhabited by the ruling communist party's supporters. But we'll be passing through the opposition party's areas and there people breaking out of the hartal might even be stopped or thrown stones at. It _shouldn't_ affect us, because our car clearly has a Karnatakan registration, so the locals will know that we're from out of state (other than us being obviously white). That's our hope at least, otherwise we may have to improvise.

Kerala's waters, the open seas and the closed backwaters, have been really good to us. The food is great, the people are kind, the lush green vegetation is enchanting. Time to cool down in the mountains of Munnar, then off to the grand wedding in Coimbatore.
