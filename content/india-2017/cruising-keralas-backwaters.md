title: Cruising Kerala's backwaters
---

The lazying around continues. We moved away from the open sea and onto the backwaters of Kerala---900km of waterways spread along 200km of the Indian shore. Our home for the next two days is a kettuvalam---a houseboat with two bedrooms, a captain, and a cook---surrounded by water, palm trees and rice fields.

The waterways here have been used for centuries as "highways", before any roads were built and cars started moving. To this day parts of the land here are accessible only by water and most of the rice grown here (the region is "Kerala's ricebowl") gets moved via boats.

The kettuvalam are a major tourist attraction here, for locals and foreigners alike. In fact, we heard about them, and were strongly recommended to take one, from our friend in Bengaluru. We're told there's over 1,500 of them floating around here, and in the tourist season most waterways are packed.

Our boat is medium-sized, compared to others we've seen so far. One deck, with two bedrooms for the four of us, plus our own captain to steer it and a cook to cater to our culinary needs. It's all inclusive, with what promises to be excellent Keralan cuisine.

There's air-conditioning at night, so we can sleep. There's no WiFi, but the excellent Indian cellular network has a steady 3G/4G signal even out here, in the middle of nowhere.
