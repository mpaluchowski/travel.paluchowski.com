title: Cruising Kerala's backwaters
---

The lazying around continues. We moved away from the open sea and onto the backwaters of Kerala---900km of waterways spread along 200km of the Indian shore. Our home for the next two days is a kettuvalam---a houseboat with two bedrooms, a captain, and a cook---surrounded by water, palm trees and rice fields.
