Sound of sea waves crashing against the shore. Their melody putting us to sleep and welcoming us to each new day. We're in Kuzhupilly Beach, just north of Kochi. The moment we arrived we _knew_ it was a most fortunate decision to spend a full four days and nights here, relaxing, recharging, looking out to sea.

We're staying at Chameleon Beach Lodge, located right at the seafront. Two terraces upstairs offer a splendid view of the water. A ten-kilometer stretch of sandy beach starts right here. Perfect for strolls and lazying around, being all but devoid of other human beings. In the evenings, the horizon occasionally gets lit up by distant thunderstorms.

The Lodge is located on a thin strip of land, separating the open sea from vast, tranquil backwaters, that go on for kilometers along the Keralan shore. Very few people live here, houses are considerably spread apart from each other. There's barely any traffic. It's perfect. Plenty of space, both physical and mental. We can write, we can read, or we can simply sit there gaping into the distance, with nothing but peace on our minds.

Turns out we arrived here shortly past the tourist season. I never thought India would even have the concept of a "tourist season", since the weather is always so hot here. Perhaps with the exception of monsoon season. But we were told, that the Lodge is normally quite busy, just that now it's already too hot for the (mostly) westerners patronizing the place.

Chameleon Beach Lodge itself its beautifully relaxed. We took our shoes off the moment we arrived and are putting it on only when we go outside of the compound. The place is owned by a local Keralan, who introduced himself as Dr Joseph. A psychologist, who spent some years back in the 80s and 90s living in Germany and traveling in Europe. He likes to speak German (on top of English) and still refers to Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia when referencing these areas in Europe.

We met other foreigners and expats here---one American and two Germans, one of them working as the head chef of a restaurant in Lucerne, Switzerland, but spending the European winter season here. He also becomes the acting manager of the Lodge, on behalf of Dr Joseph, who in turn likes to sit back, sip whiskey, chat with us and overall enjoy life. In this place, we can easily relate.

It's also really nice to have people here to talk to, other than the four of us traveling. So far we only had contact with the staff of hotels and guesthouses, who even when they wanted to have a conversation with us, didn't have a sufficiently comfortable command of English to communicate freely. Now we can talk about our thoughts and feelings and hear back from people who either live here or already spent a considerable amount of time in the country.

We continue our culinary education, exploring Keralan flavors. Tonight's dinner is supposed to be "fish Keralan style". I have no idea what that means, but the staff asked us whether we want that or fried fish "European style" and we definitively liked the former better. We can eat European back in Europe.

Dinners are special events at the Lodge, when the whole staff and all guests meet together. Dishes are prepared upfront by a local lady on staff. I think she spends half a day cooking up the curries, chutneys, parottas and various forms of rice (with shredded coconut! yum!), that is then landing in six to eight bowls on the table for us to mix and match. Banana Curry! Pineapple Curry! Makes me act like Pavlov's dog just thinking about it.

There's a number of small, but _very_ busy villages nearby, where we go for shopping, lunch and other activities. We call for a rikshaw, which takes us zooming through the narrow roads, streets, through the busy traffic and crowds, to wherever we want to go. With no windows and the air blowing at us riding at 40kph air-conditioning is obsolete.

Slightly down south there's also the city of Kochi, where we did some sightseeing, but I'll cover that in a dedicated post.

Locals are _extremely_ friendly. Just a minute ago, two men were passing on a scooter down the road, one saw me on the terrace writing, smiled and waved. Many people around here will do this. Greet us, stop, inquire about our names, country of origin. Kids and teenagers are the most amazing encounters. They'll ask me (seeing my camera) to shoot photos of them, or they'll take out their smartphones and ask for joint selfies. We're happy to go along.

Three religions mix in this region: Hindu, Islam and Christianity, I don't know in which order. The dominating one differs from place to place. Slightly up north we saw a lot of mosques and emblems of Islam, down here we see a lot of Christian churches---some of them fancy, and a lot of them really, really kitschy. Think of a statue of Mary surrounded by and covered by blinking lights and you'll get a sense of the dominating style. Nothing bad about it. Merely shows how any successful imported religion will always adopt a local flavor.

We'll be moving away from the beach tomorrow, but staying _on_ the backwaters of this region, this time accommodated on floating houseboats. We'll miss the sunsets, the sun slowly, almost vertically diving into the ocean, marking the finish of another rewarding day.
