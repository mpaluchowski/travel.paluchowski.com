title: India's dirty side
---

We have been warned. A friend said this is the most trash-infested country he's ever seen. Others told told hair-spiking stories of public defecation and littering. We're not nearly as shocked as we expected to be, but still various forms of pollution are enough of a problem here that it warrants a dedicated post.

It doesn't take much to spot garbage. Even if a particular street seems relatively clean, it's enough to look into a side alley or an unused parcel, to see piles that must've been building up there for years. Places popular with tourists---palaces, temples---are no exception.

Big cities are marginally better than the small ones. Bengaluru was OK-ish in this regard. Kochi was perhaps the worst we've seen though, with a lot of trash accumulating near the Chinese Fish Nets in Fort Kochi. Then there were the numerous rubble piles we've seen in Mysuru.

It disgusted us when we saw the scale of littering last year in Bali. India wasn't nearly as shocking. Perhaps because we've been told such nasty things before, that once we came here we though it's actually not that bad.

It's obviously a mentality thing---a random man in the street unpacking something he just bought at the adjacent shop and casually dropping the plastic packaging on the street beneath him. This needs to change---that man needs to gain awareness that he's doing something wrong---before any more _advanced_ topics are introduced, like recycling.

To be fair here, I've seen some people act exactly the same way in Poland---dropping packaging, bottles, cups into the closest ditch or bush on their way anywhere. But since the situation in Poland is not nearly as bad, I'm guessing there are far fewer such people, and we have much more efficient public cleaning services.

So is anything changing in India? It seems so. We've seen a number of signals in public and private spaces, promoting responsible approaches to handling trash disposal. From the simple "Please maintain the cleanness" to a somewhat vague, if ambitious, concept of "plastic-free zones". We're not quire sure what these are exactly, but we're guessing they're supposed to be sensitive areas where no plastic _should_ be brought? Or just dumped? It's confusing, because we've seen plastic packaging sold in those places, like everywhere, and similar piles of litter too.

There's also the issue of friction. How far is the closest trash can where I can dispose of something? In many of the places we've been to, it's too far. I had to carry some piece of trash for a few blocks until we finally entered some cafe and I could dispose of it.

Again, the bigger the city the better the situation. Bengaluru even occasionally had trash cans allowing for sorting trash, though I'm not sure anyone followed directions plastered on them, plus they looked quite battered and in need of replacing.

Artists are chipping in, trying to help raise awareness. In Kochi, in one of the prime locations at the seaside promenade, we've seen a large art installation called the Fish Cemetery, symbolically showing how the plastic we may casually dump inland will eventually, inevitably make it into some fish's stomach, that may then land back on our plate. It's ugly, but it's true.

Finally, there's of course the problem of meeting basic needs, like safety, food and health, before any higher needs are considered, like environmental safety. The amount of people in India living in poverty may be in sharp decline, but with a billion people living here, the remaining ones make up for a considerable number. Every one of them spends too much time every day trying to survive---make some money, acquire some food, even washing clothes is a time-sipping, physical endeavor---and doesn't have any time or attention left to devote to what happens with the stuff he dumped or burned somewhere behind his shack.

We're worried for India. It's too beautiful a country with too nice a people to remain this dirty. And obviously a billion people producing litter cannot remain without impact on the remaining six billion of Earth's citizens. We'll be cheering every initiative that works to fix the problem, and hoping the next time we visit (and by now I'm pretty sure there _will_ be a next time), things will be looking better.
