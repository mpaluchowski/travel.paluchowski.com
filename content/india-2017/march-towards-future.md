Internet access works fine. The mobile one at least. Almost everywhere we've been, we had a solid 4G signal. Only in the wildlife sanctuaries of Wayanad and Munnar did it degrade to Edge or disappeared completely. Mobile access was better than wi-fi at every single hotel we stayed at, be that in metropolies or seaside towns.

Getting SIM cards is another story though. India lives under a constant threat of terror attacks and it shows in security measures at public places, as well as in some beaurocratic procedures. To get a regular, prepaid SIM we needed to fill in lengthy forms, attach our _photos_ and provide the name of a local Indian person vouching for us. Then to get the cards activated, we had to call a specified number, type our passport numbers, birth dates, and afterwards still wait for another 24 hours for activation.

Compare that with SIM card vending machines at London Heathrow Airport, which I've seen there at least a year ago. Perhaps in today's times, when most countries require some form of mobile phone registration, there needs to be some way of identifying oneself, but I'm sure it can be organized less burdensome.

I wrote extensively about the quality of roads, so just in summary it bears repeating, that it's mostly decent. Straight, solid asphalt, both on the major national highways as well as on local interstate roads. Only the very rural roads were bumpy and we drove those twice when reaching our accommodation in the mountains of Wayanad and Munnar.

Road construction works are a pain when present. It's great that the country is upgrading its infrastructure, it's just being done with little concern for the flow of traffic. On the highway between Polacky and Coimbatore there's some 20km of roadworks, where the main road got scraped and bypasses lead through raw gravel on the side. It's messy, it's dirty and slows down travel even more than the regular, chaotic traffic.

Speaking of traffic, wild driving is a commonly accepted reality in India and other Asian countries, but perhaps that's an area where the country should also work to improve. In mathematical terms, a road network is simply a system that should be optimized for throughput, which in turn works best with an organized flow. I'm sure there's some good research on the topic already, and I'll risk putting forward a theory, that if Indians were to drive more orderly, they'd have quicker and shorter commutes.

Ecology is big on the agenda. Yes, there's lots and lots of litter everywhere and that won't change for a while, until the psyche of the people changes. But there visibly are laws in power that actively work to reduce the environmental footprint of the country's billion people. In many places we received cotton grocery bags instead of plastic, and we always had to pay extra for them. Bigger cities, like Bengaluru, have some trash sorting and recycling system in place. Some restaurants still served us water in plastic bottles, but many opted for juts or refillable bottles instead. Also, many individuals carried their own water in reusable containers.

CFLs and LED lights are dominating. We even saw a sizable windfarm in Tamil Nadu, between Udumalpet and Pollachi. I also saw sunlight collectors heating water in a number of homes. Haven't spotted sun batteries, but I'm guessing they're also popping up with all the sunlight India is getting. There's a lot to do for the environment, but progress is visible everywhere.

Energy supply is perhaps still a bit fragile. While we were in Chameleon Beach Lodge in Kerala, one day power went out and staid off for the better part of the afternoon. We haven't experienced outages elsewhere, but I did notice a lot of buildings had their own power generators on standby.

Payments became a hot topic last November, when the government introduced a sudden "demonetization", from one day to another removing all 500 and 1,000 notes, replacing them with new 500 and 2,000 ones and for months reducing the amounts people were allowed to pay out of ATMs. We're lucky we arrived just after these measures were lifted.

Many places accept credit cards. Most of the accommodation we used and perhaps half of the restaurants we've been to. Sometimes the place would accept cards, but not "international" ones. I'm always puzzled why global companies, like Visa or MasterCard don't work harder to make sure that a piece of plastic with their name on it isn't accepted globally all the same. They certainly have the muscle to push local banks and authorities into making their card payment systems origin-agnostic.

ATMs were a similar story. Widely available, even in small towns. Some of them would accept our cards, some of them didn't. Pretty often we encountered "no cash" signs on them and had to look elsewhere. All of them had a hard limit of paying out only IDR 10,000 at once, which was usually enough, unless we needed to pay for some longer accommodation or our driver in cash. There was always a surcharge of IDR 200 for international cards, independent of the amount we paid out.

Finally, the toilets. Sanitation in India is a topic big enough that it even [has its own TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks/joe_madiath_better_toilets_better_life). All the places we've been to had decent toilets (otherwise we wouldn't have staid there anyway), but in many, many public places, restaurants and such, there was simply no toilet paper. There was the "bum gun", if lucky, or just a bucket and a jug if not. I'm not even sure how to effectively use the latter and I know for a fact that the locals aren't too good at it either, because most of these toilets had floors simply flooded with water. So, the procedure is to use some water to wash oneself, then go to the washroom to (hopefully) wash hands where... there was commonly no soap. Then go off to eat. Hence eating is done only with one's right hand, while the left one is used for... other purposes. Yuck.

Toilet paper is expensive. Perhaps twice as much as in Poland, we've seen. I'm not sure if that's simply because of low demand, hence lack of scale to drive costs down, or because of any other reasons. At the _very_ least I'd expect to have soap available everywhere, even if the water treatment remains, and perhaps it's time to phase out that one also. Our girls had a reasonable, but unanswered question: how does one safely clean oneself, when wearing this massive saree? Humanly impossible with only two hands. Go figure.

## What the...?

Internet, roads, payments, toilets... all standard stuff to compare between developing and developed countries. We looked at it all in a logical fashion. But then there are moments, when logic goes out the window and you encounter things happening that just don't fit into what you'd consider a modern country---or at least one aspiring to modernity.

Like groups of "cow vigilantes" lynching people on the suspicion of them having beef at home. Or a married [couple getting burned alive for the suspicion of committing sourcery](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mob-set-afire-couple-alleging-sorcery/article17864125.ece). Or [women marrying men from castes considered unacceptable, seeing their husbands killed](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/when-victims-of-caste-violence-came-face-to-face/article18064601.ece). What the...? Seriously?
