title: Teatime in Munnar

Time to cool off. It's 25C tops here and down to 16C in the early morning. A cool breeze passes through. Clouds lazily crawl over the mountain tops, bringing rain in the afternoon, from a light drizzle to a heavy rainfall. Everywhere we look it's green and mountain slopes are covered with tea plantations.

We made it to Munnar despite the hartal, though it wasn't exactly a smooth ride. A group of protesters stopped us when we closed in to Kochi, literally surrounded the car and started explaining in mixed English that we cannot go onwards and what the reason for the protest is. They were generally peaceful and friendly, but still being surrounded by a group of somewhat angered men wasn't exactly a pleasant experience.

Turned out one of the protesters was either an acquaintance of our driver, or had some different relationship---perhaps coming from the same city. He helped us negotiate our release. We were just suggested to put a sign saying, in capital letters, "HOSPITAL" because that was one of the exceptions that permitted us to go. And off we went.

This wasn't the only road block. We still had to stop on the way in three or four places. Either because a protest was marching, or the locals were stopping cards for "5 minutes", then permitting them to move on.

The places we passed on our way were literally ghost towns. Like, nobody on the streets. All the shops, restaurants, parlors closed. Where normally hundreds and thousands of people roam the streets, on foot, motorbikes, scooters and in other ways, there was nobody.

Other than the roadblocks, this actually helped us reach the destination faster. The benefit: no traffic!

Munnar is the most distinct location on our route because of its location---high up in the mountains, which makes the weather significantly cooler. We were a bit worried earlier that the accommodation we chose didn't have air-conditioning nor fans, but these turned out unnecessary. The top temperature at daytime was a pleasant 25C with a low of 16C in the early morning. We actually had to take out our blouses for the evening---a first since we arrived in India.

The mild climate makes growing tea possible. Plantations cover large areas around Munnar---hilltops, slopes, valleys, all green, all covered top to bottom with densely packed, low bushes. I did most of the photos in the evening after we arrived. The sun was already hidden behind one of the mountains and there wasn't enough light to highlight all the shades of green that the surroundings present.

Our accommodation, called Green Magic Home is another one worth mentioning because of the stunning view from the terrace, where we spent our evening and then had our breakfast served. The small house is settled on a mountain slope overlooking the valley near Munnar (but not the city itself), with a view on the surrounding mountains, a view villages down in the valley, boundless carpets of tea plantations cut through by narrow service roads and paths between the bushes.

There's nothing else to do here. No temples, palaces nearby. Just the greenness to enjoy. We thought we might check out the wildlife sanctuary on our way later from Munnar to Coimbatore, but sadly we won't have enough time. It'll take us 5.5 hours of driving, not including a pit stop for lunch, and we still need to pick up our clothing for the wedding before the shops close on Friday evening.

I think we've struck a very decent balance this time, between actively sightseeing, diving into the local life of India, and chilling out, catching up on reading and writing. Munnar's our last stop before the grand event of the wedding in Coimbatore. As always, time flew much faster than we expected it to.
