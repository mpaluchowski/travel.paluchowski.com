title: Weight watchers' nightmare
---

Two kilograms each, and none of it is muscle. That's how much weight we gained during the two weeks of eating Indian food. There's so much of it, and so diverse, we wanted to try _everything_. And it's often so good, it's hard to stop even when we know we should.

All Indian food is spicy. Well, not exactly _all_ of it, but in every meal there will usually be some dish that's spicy. Restaurant menus will normally _not_ mark the spicy dishes, so if your preference is for something milder, you better ask explicitly. Good thing all four of us do enjoy hot flavors and often times we actually had to assure the staff serving us that it was perfectly fine to make our food spicy---the way they'd make it for themselves.

I was actually disappointed with how few dishes I personally found truly spicy. Some Kadais and Vindaloos mostly. The rest caused some tickling on the tongue, but only slightly so. That could've been for any of the following reasons:

* the restaurants prepared milder versions for us, assuming we white folks couldn't take it,
* the cuisine isn't that spicy after all, or we've chosen the less spicy dishes,
* the climate changed our taste, as it always does. When in a hot climate, one can always eat things that are spicier and sweeter, compared to the same person being in a cooler place.

In any case, if you don't like spicy food, you'll have a hard time in India. If you do, you'll be fine, though perhaps you won't be that impressed with just how hot the food is.

It's cheap. By western standards obviously, and even by our still modest Polish standards. We could easily find decent restaurants that cost €15-20 to feed all four of us. We've also been to a few more upscale ones, some of them calling themselves "fine dining", where the prices were around mid-range Warsaw offerings. Perhaps the most expensive place we've been to, Bird on Tree in Coimbatore, cost us €30 for a dinner for three.

Granted, there's no alcohol included. There's very little alcohol consumed or even available overall. Just when we were in the country, a High Court's ruling came into force forbidding the sale of any alcohol within 500m range from national highways, in order to reduce the number of drunk drivers. I'm not sure how effective a measure this'll be, but it did close down a number of shops and bars, while placing massive queues at those which remained open. In Kochi we saw a liquor store with some 200 people queuing at. Another one in Coimbatore had perhaps 100 persons waiting.

Alcohol is available generally, in selected stores and some of the restaurants, mostly catering to foreigners and well-off Indians. In Bengaluru we've even been to a brewpub making very decent craft beers and serving very British pub food, mixed up with some Indian inspirations.

Not that we missed the booze. We've all but ditched alcohol in the last few months, largely because we seem to be enjoying it much less than we used to. Plus, it's great for improving sleep quality.

The low cost of food, combined with the massive variety of flavors, colors and overall excellent taste, made it all too easy for us to overeat. We must've consumed some 15-20,000 calories above our needs, which shouldn't have been too hard from all the thick curries, breads and rice. Hence the weight gains, though I'm sure we'll get rid of them with a week or two. After all, triathlon season is starting soon and there'll be ample opportunities for burning calories.

Anyone who's ever been to an Indian restaurant will know what to expect. Tens of dishes with unfamiliar names, often curries---thick sauces with meat or vegetables, in multiple colors---aside from options with rice and a number of bread varieties: naans, parathas, chapatas, rotis and others.

Each state will have its own specialties, also the level of spicy-ness differs. Kerala was perhaps the least spicy state we visited, Karnataka the most.

We tried to taste as many different dishes as possible. Not easy because we couldn't understand much of the menus, so we also couldn't quite remember what we had before. Lunch offerings were often a great bet, because these would commonly consist of a number of dishes, each in a small bowl, with bread and rice. Chicken bits were tricky, because they usually weren't the breast or thigh fillets we were expecting, but whole pieces, with bones and other tough parts. Not much meat on them and a bit of difficulty to extract it.

And the fruits... oh, the fruits... These were absolutely excellent. We drank a ton of watermelon juice, ate lots of mangos, some coconuts. An Indian restaurant owner in Warsaw told me once that a mango can only ripen properly in the heat of India's climate and having tasted it there locally, I know what he meant. Bananas must've been available in some fifteen varieties, none of which resembled the standard "Chiquita" ones we have in Poland. From finger-sized to red, fat blobs, to cooking plantains. All of them great.

I actually think that most of the weight gains we made were from the sugar in these fruits. Perhaps together with all the breads we ate.

Eating by hands is the norm. The right hand that is. There was always a pair of spoon and fork available for us, but many (if not most) of the locals would only use spoons to pour curries over rice, then squish it together with their hand, form small bunches and put it in their mouths. We even saw some people, mostly elderly, puring soup with a spoon into their cupped hand and then drinking from it.

If you're concerned about the hygienic aspect of this approach, every restaurant we've been to had a sizable washroom. Everyone entering went first to wash their hands, then did the same after the meal. Soap was usually available, but not everywhere. For our own safety, we opted to use some anti-bacterial gel too.

Water purity is often a concern for westerners coming to countries like India. Not so much here. Everywhere we went, very often each table was already set with a sealed bottle of water. In some of the more environmentally-conscious places, water was poured from jugs or refillable glass bottles, and it was also properly purified drinking water.

What we're used to in Poland is that bottled water equals mineral waster---extracted from underground reservoirs, where it filtered through over time, purified by natural processes and contains minerals from the soil and rocks it passed through. In India, it's simply "packaged drinking water", meaning it was taken from some reasonably clean source, then UV-treated, ozonized, and sometimes minerals get added in the production process.
