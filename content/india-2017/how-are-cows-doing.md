title: How are cows doing?
---

I figured you'd ask. We use the expression "sacred cow" in many languages outside of India, so the way cows are treated here became a bit of a legend. We were curious ourselves, how much of it is true? Some of it is, in some places, some of the time.

The story goes (in case you haven't heard it) that cows in India have a very special status, being worshiped by the Hindus, representing fertility and nurturing. Eating beef is obviously _off limits_, and the animals are roaming the roads, meadows and wherever they please freely. Even the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affair's travel guide includes a remark, that doing any harm to a cow (as in hitting it with a car) may cause trouble with the locals.

We have met a number of cows. In Mysuru and throughout lowland Kerala they've been walking around largely unobstructed, munching on whatever they found tasty. Plants, grass, flowers hanging off cars and motorcycles.

Some of them were clearly owned and herded though. At Kuzhupili Beach a number of residents owned some cows, which were bound to local trees, milked and otherwise taken care of. I suspect all of the other animals we've seen walking without any binding were also owned and watched over by somebody. They weren't "wild cows" if you will.

Finding beef on the menu is rare, but we did see it once or twice. And I'm sure we'd see more if we went to non-Indian restaurants. India being this big and diverse obviously hosts various people, some of whom would never eat beef, others happily would.

Having said that, an article in [The Hindu newspaper][the-hindu] caught my attention:

> [O]fficials found there was no evidence of cow slaughter by Mohammed Akhlaq, who was __beaten and lynched in 2015 on the suspicion of storing beef in his house__ at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh. [emphasis mine]

The same text mentioned another incident, very recent "in Alwar, Rajasthan, where a man was lynched by a mob claiming to be cow protectors." The press calls them "cow vigilantes" and apparently the activity of such groups is partly protected by the law:

> [T]he Gujarat Animal Prevention Act, 1965 which deemed that __all who acted to protect cows were public servants__ and no legal action shall be instituted against them. [emphasis mine]

It looks like doing harm to a cow, and often even the _suggestion_ that somebody may have done such, may be life threatening in some areas of India---mostly in the northern states. Down here in the south it's probably safer, although we still wouldn't like to be involved in any controversies.

Are the stories about the status of cows in India true? It's complicated. As much as the fabric of this country.
