<!--more-->

The wedding is a three-day event. We're told that that's the modern-times' "short" version of what used to be a week of ceremonies in the old days, just because people are more busy nowadays. Why this long? It relates to how many people will typically attend. Thousands. The wealthier the family the more it'll be, and in our friend's case the final number oscillated around _five_ thousand. That's some _fifty times more_ than you'll have at a typical wedding in Poland.

Three days times five thousand people means a lot of opportunities for networking, which is a major component of the wedding. Relationships matter a lot in India and theses events are a way to maintain them, within the circles of geographically dispersed families, friends and acquaintances.

I was heavily surprised by just _how little_ the event centered around the bride & groom and the procedures they were going through. Mind you, at any given time their closest relatives were present with them, and a few hundred people were watching from the audience seats. But the people focused on the couple were just a subset of everyone in the facility. The rest were coming in or out, eating, sipping coffee, chatting.

The wedding starts on Saturday morning with the bride-to-be receiving blessings from her own family, orchestrated by the women. Relatively few guests attend this portion of the event, mostly family and close friends. The facility is still only being setup, stage is being built, speakers and screens installed (if any), chairs laid out. The groom is free to wander the facility and welcome guests. Mid-day everyone is off to prepare for the evening event.

Late afternoon, on the same Saturday, the biggest portion of the event starts. Not the main one---that's on Sunday morning---but with the most people attending. It's the grooms time, starting with his visit to the nearest temple to pray for the successful marriage. Then there'll be a small clash between the groom's ensemble, led by himself, and the bride's. Because traditionally the groom arrives and asks for the bride to come out to meet him, which is not what should happen. It's the groom that should go in and find his bride. So there's negotiating, a bit of pushing around, some shouting, some laughing. Finally, the groom gives in and walks into the facility to meet his future wife.

Then there are photos. Lots and lots of photos. The future newlyweds (they're _not_ married yet at this point) will spend a good few hours now on stage with the five thousand people coming up, telling wishes, giving presents and posing for photos. I haven't asked our friend yet, but it looked like the most physically straining part of the whole event.

Saturday evening is the closest it gets to what we call a "wedding reception" in the western world. There's music---a pair of local singers performing live---but _no_ dancing (we were disappointed on this one, hoping for a bit of Bollywood-style choreographies, but apparently that's a north-Indian thing), and there's plenty of food. Buffets of breads, chutneys, curries, rice (obviously) and all the other spice-filled Indian delicacies. We couldn't really understand a thing from the menu, printed all in Tamil, but thankfully the buffet setup allowed us to choose by sight & smell.

Saturday's the moment when we realized we should've practiced eating with our hands. All food was presented to us on coconut palm tree leaves, with no utensils. So we did a quick recap of what we knew:

* touch food with your _right_ hand only,
* squeeze a small chunk of food together,
* put it in your mouth keeping your hand horizontally and lightly pushing the food with your thumb.

It worked all right, we managed. At some point we were offered spoons, which we politely declined. Wouldn't want to have our bragging rights taken away for this one.

Finally, the Sunday. The wedding ceremony starts around 7:30AM, but the day started a lot earlier for us. Had to get out of bed at 5AM, get clean and ready for the girls' sarees to arrive just before 6AM and followed by stylists to help put on the sarees. Many of today's young Indian women don't know how to do that, relying on their mothers, aunts and other elders.

In our case, by 6:20AM the ladies still didn't arrive and, knowing we'd be otherwise late to the ceremony, we went for plan B: YouTube. There's a number of videos online showing step by step how to put on a saree. Simple enough, "in 10 minutes". Not quite. Turns out the girl needs to have a skirt underneath to hold some of the cloth and one needs a number of pins to connect parts of the material. Even folding is a bit of an art. We did some trial and error for 20 minutes, then gave up. Whatever we tried looked awful. Plan C it was then: pack up and go to the event hoping someone there could help us. Just as we were leaving at 6:45AM we met the two ladies down in the hotel's reception. Took them 20 minutes to get our girls ready and wrapped.

The two of us guys had a much, much easier time. Any decent shirt will do for the top part---and I happened to have bought a very nice, light shirt back in Musuru---then for the bottom there's the simple, white cloth dhoti. It used to be tricky to fasten it so that it wouldn't slide down, but nowadays these come with velcro, so putting it on takes 10 seconds. There's even a pocked, heavily advertised as a feature, big enough for wallet and phone. Lest you think that's unimportant---sarees and traditional dhotis have no pockets, so all of the women and many of the men at the event walked with wallets, car keys and phones in their hands at all times.

We arrived, somewhat late, but not really. There never seems to be a fixed time to anything starting in India. It's more of an event time, where things start when enough people are ready.

This was _the_ wedding proper---bride and groom tying knots together (literally! at one point), priests chanting, lots of flower petals and rice being thrown around the newlyweds to ensure their success. The ceremony took around an hour. We weren't quite sure at which point the couple actually became married. The priest leading the ceremony spent a lot of time explaining (in Tamil, but we've been told) how the newlyweds should act so that they have a good marriage. Useful stuff, definitively, though I suspect it's a leftover from the days when the bride and groom may have met for the first time ever only at their wedding, and definitively could've used some advice. Nowadays our friend's been talking to his fiance via various online means for months, ever since they were introduced to each other.

Then photos (again), more food (delicious as always) and by mid-day the official part of the wedding was over. Lest you think the couple could now enjoy some time together, no way. There's still stuff to do.

Sunday afternoon the couple moves to the bride's "native place"---her traditional family home, where she was born and often raised. They spend a night there. Then they pack up and on Monday morning they drive to the groom's "native place", together with the whole ensemble of the bride's family. This is where we were to meet them again, some 60km east of Coimbatore.

We were welcomed by our friend's parents and truly treated like guests of honor. We even got our red and yellow dots painted on our foreheads, together with the welcoming and blessings.

Monday is the least formal part of the event. It's only the very closest people present, mostly blood-relatives of different, closer stages. There's a bit of ceremony where the bride and groom go first to the local temple, but then it's just meeting, talking, eating and sipping delicious mango & watermelon juice. We even managed to catch them for 15 minutes to give our personal wishes and a few specialty gifts we prepared back in Poland.

Sadly we couldn't stay long, facing six hours of driving to Bengaluru, where we had to make it before 10PM that evening. What we know is that the newlyweds will spend another month (perhaps a few) visiting all of their relatives. Networking and relationship-building all over again.

It was a long and intense weekend. Adding to our enjoyment was the fact that we were the only white people at the event. We stood out just by our skin color, and our attempts to dive into the local culture. People were very much excited seeing us wear traditional clothing---the sarees and the dhotis. Many welcomed us, inquired about our origins, complimented on the clothing (and our ability to eat with hands), invited to visit them in various parts of the country (we'd love to!). To the point where the groom joked that we might've been a bigger deal than the newlyweds themselves!

Indian wedding: check! it is then. It was busy, it was noisy, it was exciting and absolutely lovely to be there. We're mighty happy for our friends getting married and that we could've been a part of it. The only regret we have is that the wedding culminated our trip and the drive to Bengaluru was the beginning of our long way back to Poland.
