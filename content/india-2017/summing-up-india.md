Is it a month already? Seems like we came back just yesterday. We're dearly missing the weather of India---the heat, the sunshine, and yes, the humidity of Kerala's lush green seaside. Actually, there's plenty we loved there and even more we haven't seen yet. Must. Come. Back. Some day.

It's 15C, overcast, with occasional rain outside the window as I'm writing this. The middle of a rather wet and cool springtime in Poland and summer is still more than a month away. Makes it all the easier to drift away mentally back to India, where it was hot---all day, every day. If it was located any closer, we would've loved to drop by for a weekend just to recharge batteries.

Admittedly, India's weather is not suitable for everyone. One of our posse of four found it most comfortable in the cool mountains of Munnar, where the day's top temperature was a mere 25C. But overall, we found it a very pleasant experience to escape Poland's winter just as it was passing end of March. In some places it was heavy at times---particularly the 40C temperatures of Tamil Nadu. Still, we would've happily go back.

I mentioned in my first impressions, right after we saw a bit of Bengaluru, that we found ourselves surprised with how comfortable we felt in the country. How _familiar_ it had felt. That's most likely a matter of past experience. We've been to Bali before, individually to Malaysia, Ghana, South Africa, and the Balkans aren't too far either in terms of impressions. By the time we landed in Bengaluru, one of our group described me walking the streets as "there was Micha≈Ç, casually strolling through Bangalore, leading the pack as if he was right at home".

What also contributed to our feeling of comfort were the people. The beautifully friendly locals we met everywhere, who served us food, sold us groceries, inquired about our experiences or even just stopped us to ask where we're from and take a selfie. With perhaps the exception of Kochi, we never felt being treated as tourists in the sense that you get in many places, where it feels like everyone is trying to extort money from you. We could mix with the population (well, as much as our skin color permitted---we always stood out) and feel a bit of the local vibe.

Communication was never a big issue. Indians' common language is English, because every state has its own local language and none of them are like any other, so even if we couldn't have sophisticated conversations in most contacts we had, we were generally understood. The famous, unintelligible Indian accent isn't that big a deal either, it's just a matter of willingness to pay attention and patience. Even "native" speakers of English are often difficult to understand. Ever heard a Scotsman speak? Yeah.

One of our group said that "India has it all---hills and mountains, plains and deserts, tropical seasides, tiny villages and massive agglomerations." That's certainly our experience and we barely scratched the surface of what's possible. We could only realistically cover a small piece of the subcontinent, because the whole country is so vast and the roads wouldn't permit us to move as quickly as to cover more than 300-400km per day. And those were the long, rough days with hours spent in the car.

There's the whole central and eastern part of Tamil Nadu we haven't seen. And everything north of Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata, perhaps even New Delhi, if we ever dare. We're told the north of the country is a socially and economically more complex place than the friendly, sunny south we saw. Guess we'll have to find that out on our own.

We were positively surprised by the quality of roads---while not built for speed, they were certainly well maintained. Also, the amount of litter didn't shock us. We had been told to expect it, and some places were better than others.

Neither did poverty prove to be particularly shocking. Perhaps it's because it usually comes draped in colors. India is a very colorful country---from the land, through spices to the clothing. Even the poorest of people dressed beautifully and if we didn't see the conditions they were living in, we might've never noticed how poor they were.

India is certainly on its way to modernity. Just in the last 35 years, since 1980 or so, [India's GDP per capita increased fivefold and life expectancy grew by 12 years][gapmider-india]. And these trends continue upwards. When you consider that it's a country with a population of over one billion, that's a _lot_ of children who are not dying anymore, and a _lot_ of economic output produced.

We met a number of young Indians, including our good friend, who go abroad to study---often in Europe---and when asked what they would like to do afterwards, they all said that _of course_ they'll come back to India to work. Going abroad, getting an education, learning the good stuff, then coming back to apply at it a home. Sounds like a recipe for success. We're certainly yet to see the best of India. And I'm hopeful that the bad sides will slowly but surely diminish. Like the litter, and most certainly the odd, violent tribal behaviors.

Yes, we'll be back. No idea when. There's still a lot of places to see around the world and only so much time. For the time being, if you're considering visiting India---go for it. And if you're worried about the heat, the hygiene, the traffic or even the spiciness of food---don't. You'll be just fine, and if you're in trouble, the locals will be happy to assist. Just go.
