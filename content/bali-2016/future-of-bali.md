A bike lane. Not something I expect to see in a city where most streets have no sidewalks, yet there it was. Painted on a road lit by LED street lights and... unceremoniously used by cars. Bali is dipping its toes in modernity while still firmly footed in ways of the old.

The first thing I noticed shortly after arrival was that we were given receipts pretty much everywhere we paid for something. Shops, restaurants, parking lots and tourist attractions---all these were recording their cash flow in a clear, readable format. That meant traceability and accountability, characteristics of well developed countries.

The second thing I noticed were the compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) used everywhere and not _one_ incandescent light bulb in sight. The CFLs are now gradually being superseded by LED lights, already omnipresent in traffic lights and other road equipment, where they're often accompanied by solar panels. There's clearly some environmental awareness around here.

I did my fair share of [complaining about Bali]({{< ref "bali-2016/which-way-to-paradise.md" >}}) throughout the three weeks we've been there, from traffic through trash to the rather [unsophisticated food]({{< ref "bali-2016/rice-nation.md" >}}). The truth is there are plenty of signs of progress around the island, especially in the big cities of the south---Denpasar, Sanur nad Kuta. Signals that the people of Bali increasingly want to live a healthy, comfortable _and_ sustainable life. There's a whole spread though, from the forefront of this progress to the lowest not-givin'-a-damn group.

Yes, [traffic is dense on most streets]({{< ref "bali-2016/rules-of-the-road.md" >}}) and walking is usually a balancing act between getting hit by a passing scooter and falling into a rain ditch. But some of the main streets already have sidewalks---narrow, frequently used by scooters to overtake traffic, but still---and their availability increased dramatically over the last few years. Bikers are not an uncommon sight and their numbers are also growing, a trend I reckon will continue as dedicated infrastructure becomes available.

A week into our vacation, the local transformer made a loud "boom" and... died, leaving us without electricity---most annoyingly no cooling and no internet access. But the fixing crew came over quite quickly and attacked a truck-mounted transformer to quickly bring the power back while they continued working on the stationary equipment.

Internet access was available literally everywhere. At our guesthouse, obviously, in _every_ single restaurant and café---with prominent signs shouting "Free WiFi!"---even grocery stores offered connectivity. At the same time, quality of the connections was _appalling_. Super slow or downright not working. The local Starbucks and one other café were marginally better but even there a synchronization operation that takes some twenty seconds back at home took minutes here.

Cards are accepted in major shops, some mid-level and most upscale restaurants. All the terminals rely on chip cards, not the old-school magnetic stripes. Still, cash is king and some 90+ of our payments was with banknotes. Thankfully, ATMs are widely available.

Finally, I mentioned earlier that trash is literally everywhere. A regular person will casually drop whatever they're holding---an empty plastic cup or cigarette box packing---over their shoulder without even a thought crossing their mind that this might be inappropriate. But then, I don't remember seeing a trash can anywhere in the streets, so being environmentally conscious does take some effort.

At the same time, there's this massive [ForBALI movement](http://www.forbali.org/) going on right now, with huge banners waving everywhere in the cities. They're [protesting against the development and resulting destruction of Benoa Bay](https://www.engagemedia.org/forbali-the-struggle-againts-benoa-bay-reclamation), which would be a small natural disaster. There's also [Green School]({{< ref "bali-2016/green-school.md" >}}). Clearly, there are people in Bali who care a _lot_ about the environment and their numbers are growing.

It's all contrasts, everywhere you look.

A number of people we spoke to---locals and permanent residents---were well traveled people. They've been places, often studied in Australia or other well developed country and then came (back) to Bali, bringing their newly acquired awareness of how orderly a place might become and how comfortable it becomes then for its citizens. These people are driving change, light bulb after light bulb, street after street, garbage can after garbage can. And their numbers are growing, especially in a world so tightly connected as ours.

There's hope. I can see Bali becoming the paradise it's meant to be, not just inside the confines of a few luxury resorts and in those postcards, where a photographer deliberately cut out the surroundings of whatever they were photographing. Slowly, gradually but steadily ahead.
