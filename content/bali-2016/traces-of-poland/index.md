I wasn't expecting to find any. We're almost as far from Poland as physically possible while still remaining on the surface of Earth. I _was_ expecting getting mixed up with Holland, which to the untrained ear sounds just the same, and then blank stares once we repeat "no, __PO__land". And I was wrong.

<!--more-->

We've been **asked by pretty much _every single person_** we encountered "where are you from?" Casually, just like that, second or third sentence uttered. I always made a point of carefully stressing the pronunciation: _POOOland_, to make sure we're distinguished from the [omnipresent Dutch]({{< ref "/bali-2016/the-vagabonders/index.md" >}}) (and don't get charged like we were Dutch---we have been offered better prices more than once after answering the question).

Reactions we received surprised me _every_ time:

* "your flag is just like ours, upside down",
* "Robert Lewandowski! The football player?"
* "Podolski, he's Polish, right?"
* "the previous pope was Polish, wasn't he? Ah, no, the one before him?"

All true. (Well, Podolski partly so, but let's not be picky.)

The best part came when we __visited a meeting of [Magical Bali Toastmasters](https://magicalbali.toastmastersclubs.org/)__, with the theme "One World, One Family" (in celebration of [United Nations Day](https://www.un.org/en/events/unday/)), and the word of the day "Solidarity". Made me laugh, as I immediately thought about the [Polish trade union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)) and what it meant in the history of our country. I thought that'd be a good story to tell during the Table Topics session or chatting with the club's members.

Then I was floored, as the Toastmasters of the evening began to explain the theme, then the word of the day, and __proceeded to introduce the Polish organization__! I thought I would be telling the people here a bit of history of Poland, instead I was the one being told.

None of these are obscure facts, mind you. They're widely known names linked with major events---at least we _think_ so in Poland. But then every continent and region has its own affairs and I didn't think these facts would travel this far. Especially since __so few visitors from Poland seem to visit here__---we only encountered our fellow citizens three times over the course of three weeks.

Turns out people in Bali know more about Poland than the Poles know about Bali.
