A fort here, a battery there. Everywhere you look in Malta, there are defensive structures left over from centuries of either being under active, fierce attack by some power willing to control the little islands, or living in fear of the next assault. These structures are perhaps *the* definiting feature of the country, and the most memorable elements of my stay.

Military history starts here with the **Ottomans**, who, having first chased the Order of St. John off the island of Rhodes, later came after them on Malta, [laying siege to the island for almost four months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Siege_of_Malta) until they got worn out and left. For good. But the Order was expecting they would come again, and decided to invest heavily in defenses. Valetta was built as a fortified city, essentially, a military zone. Forts were constructed at the entrance to the Grand Harbour, and inside of it, with walls that were meters thick, and tens of meters high above both sea level, and surrouding ground. These hosted cannons that could shower oncoming enemies with projectiles in all directions, protecting first primarily against land attacks, and then from the sea.

All these defenses were being upgraded over centuries, with extensions, newer, bigger, faster guns, following the evolution of military technology.

Why all this effort and expense, bordering on panic? Because Malta seemed to be located in the perfect spot for:

- any major military force to stop over and refuel during a large campaign, as with **Napoleon's**,
- or the island could be used to intercept and harass fleets and convoys passing by, as with the **Axis**-controlled supplies to Italy and North Africa. 

The Order of St. John merely wanted to survive, but after they were [expelled by the French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Malta), who were then [kicked out by the British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Malta_(1798%E2%80%931800)), whatever power held control over the islands wanted to keep that control tightly.

So, in Malta, and particularly in Valetta and its surrounding peninsulas, military history is everywhere. You turn a corner, and there's a bastion, a cavallier, or at least a [row of embrasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrasure), sometimes with a gun still in them, more often with trases of old gun mounts. The Grand Harbour alone has sevel full forts, if I counted correctly, and numerous smaller batteries along the shoreline.

I visited two of the forts: **Fort Saint Elmo** in Valetta and **Fort Saint Angelo** in Birgu. They're worth visiting alone for offering the best views of the harbour and its cities. But they're also tangible records of military history of the last five centuries. Some of the structures date back to the years immediatley following the Ottoman siege. Many were later modified, upgraded, with the most recent ones built for World War II, with observation towers, various command and control posts.

Then there's the tunnel under the Upper Barrakka Gardens, which I stumbled upon somewhat accidentally, that hosts a museum of the former **Lascaris War Rooms** -- the command center for all the branches of the British Military during World War II. This is where they observed incoming air raids -- of which they received multiples every day between 1940 and 1942 -- and this is where the allied commanders directed the [invasion of Sicilly in 1943](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Sicily), that opened a new front in the war.

I once overheard an elderly British couple exclaiming that they "never saw a place this fortified", and I concur.

At times it even felt like Valetta was still under siege (and not by the throngs of tourists that pack the main streets for most of the day and night). Explosions of various types could be heard from different directions, starting around noon and into the late evening. Sometimes it was the salluting battery, formerly greeting important ships entering the Grand Harbour, nowadays making noise for the pleasue of tourists. Most of the times it was fireworks, when one of the surounding communes celebrated, of which there are many, and every one seems to have had some reason to celebrate this weekend.

I reckon the locals should be a tad tired with all the noise of the shooting that's so pervasive. I'm also sure that for the elders of the islands, those sounds might offer relief knowing that they're, finally, a sign of peace.
