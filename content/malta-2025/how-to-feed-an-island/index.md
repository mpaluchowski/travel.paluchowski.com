They look like column bases, but their layout was too uneven to have supported any building structure. I ran into them in an open plaza right in front of Fort Saint Elmo in Valetta. Didn't look too pretty, so I decided no to take a photo, and moved on, leaving behind the puzzle of their purpose. Only later in the day did I realize what they were: granaries.

Feeding the population of a tiny, arid island, such as Mala, is a tricky challenge. There are no rivers, lakes or springs. There might be underground water reservoiers, but these were inaccessibles historically, and would be insufficient to serve the modern population. And while 3,000 hours of sunshine annually might be great for tourism, it also means not a lot of nutritious food can be grown here locally.

Granted, the climate used to be a bit more forgiving a few centuries ago, so there was **wheat** grown on the island. There's a windmill street to the left of Valetta's main gate, and there are the said granaries in Valetta, Floriana, and probably elsewhere, where the local rulers kept supplies also for the times of siege.

There used to be more rain, certainly, and every major building had a courtyard with a well in the center, and a tank underneath for collecting **rainwater**. The building's roof was slightly tilted inwards, so that as much rainwater was collected through that courtyard.

That, combined with whatever **seafood** could be caught by the island's fishermen, was enough to feed the locals for most of the island's known history.

Today is different, obviously.

Malta acquires pretty much all of its water supply via **desalination** -- a process they've been at since the 1950s. It's the reason why tap water tastes a bit off. It's also an energetically very costly process. I'm told a whopping 60% of the island's produced electricity is used for desalination. And power plants run exclusively on imported gas.

I don't think I have seen any crops anywhere on the island. Those probably would've needed to be watered artificially which, with the water so dear, would've been unsustainable. It's much cheaper to import grains, and other foods.

There's seafood, but in a far smaller supply than I would've expected from a country that's surrounded by water. Baked goods and pasta seem to be in far greated supply -- perhaps an influence of nearby Italy, and certainly depended on those imported grains.

Food is mostly imported then, and water, while sourced locally, also relies on imported gas to power the desalination process.
