You would be forgiven if you couldn't spot the country on a map of Europe. It's seven kilometers from the airport terminal to my hotel in Valetta. Everywhere else is not much farther. A tiny place indeed, and not one from the top of people's bucket lists either. Why come then, and what's to do here?

Malta has been on my radar for two decades now, if ever so faintly. It joined the European Union in 2004, together with Poland. Then over a decade ago, and two jobs back, I had a colleague in our Warsaw office who was Maltese. Competent, cordial, and occasionally speaking in her native language that to me had a sound I would describe as "tannic".

Then, just two years ago, I saw a music set played from Malta by my favorite Paul Van Dyk.

Every ten years or so, the country kept reminding me of itself. This year I was looking for a place in Europe to escape to for a few days. Literally *escape*, because ever since my first child was born in late 2018 I spent in total maybe a week traveling anywhere without kids. I needed a few days just for me, myself & I. Malta fit right in.

It's not too far, less then three hours on a plane. Not too large, as I wrote earlier. Very warm, and plenty sunny.

It also has this history of connecting Europe with Africa and the Middle East for centuries, ships docking, bringing sailors, merchants, with their mixture of languages, cultures and cuisines. I always adored Mediterranean port cities. Genoa. Marseille. Palma de Mallorca. I love the narrow streets towered by stone houses. The restaurants and cafes squeezed into tiny plazas. I love walking and taking in these places.

That's also the overall plan for Malta. Walk. Discover. Enjoy. And do some writing which I haven't done since, again 2018. The last blog-worthy trip we did to Israel.

I'm planning to stick to Malta's main island. I might do a boat tour of the coast, but I wouldn't want to spend time on a ship heading to Gozo and then coming back. I only have a few days here.

My rough list of places to explore includes:

- **Valetta**, of course. The capital, my base, and where everyone seems to be staying.
- **Mdina**, the earlier capital, a fortress, perhaps as interesting as Valetta.
- **Rahal Gdid** with notable historical sites: Tarxien Temples and the Hypogeum.
- **Vittoriosa, Senglea, and Cospicua**, opposite Valetta across the bay, all of which were buzzing since the Middle Ages.
- Maybe **Marsaxlokk** with their Sunday fish market, although that'd take me more time to get to. 

One thing I won't be able to squeeze in is outdoor sports. I resigned from cycling outright. The place is too smal, and the roads don't look to cycle-friendly. I wanted to do running instead, but then I saw the narrow streets with nearly non-existent sidewalks, no parks, no seaside promenades. I resigned. What's left is good, old-fashioned callisthenics that'll probably be confined to my hotel room, as I haven't seen any outdoor equipment either. It's fine for the few days I'll be spending here.

That's about it. Rest mentally. Recharge. See something interesting. Tomorrow's my first full day here, and I'll be starting with a walking tour of Valetta. Stand by!
