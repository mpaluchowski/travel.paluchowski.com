What's that green field on my way from Valetta to Mdina? A vineyard, a park, a stadium. Zoom in. "Ta' Qali. Former RAF airfield." *Interesting. Let's see if there's anything left from that old airfield.* That's how I found myself in Ta' Qali, roughly in the middle of the island of Malta.

During World War II the British [RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force) had to have more than one airfield due to [intense bombarding from the Axis air force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Malta_(World_War_II)). They took over the unpaved airsrtip in Ta' Qali, used seasonally for civil aviation purposes, developed it, and officially named [RAF Ta Kali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Ta_Kali), twisting the local Maltese name. It remained in use by the British military until 1968 when it was handed over to the Maltese government.

I found the area almost completely reimagined and remodeled. The newest development is the **National Park**, taking up most of the southern portion of the former facility. It doesn't look like a "national park" the way I alwasy understood it -- a protected wildlife area. It's a public park, with neat pathways, cultivated greenery, a sizable amphitheatre, and a fountain. Also, it's secluded. I saw three small groups strolling the area, and that was it. Not sure if that's a matter of season, when the locals prefer to stay indoors during the hot hours.

Then there was the former airstrip. A long, wide belt, still distinctly visible on the map. Part of is is covered by the said National Park. Then there's a parking lot, where the surface might be the original tarmac from the airstrip. Then an **Adventure Park** which is a fancy way of calling a really well-equipped playground for kids of all ages. Again, empty. Two families present in total, where in Poland a place like this would've been packed on a sunny Saturday.

Further down, an even larger parking lot. Mostly empty of cars, but judging from the tracks, often used for car drifting stunts.

Finally, the last, northernmost piece of the former airstrip is used by a **Model Aircraft Association**. It has a fresh layer of tarmac, proper airfield markings, even the number of the airstrip is there. That part, sadly, was fenced off, and closed shut. Probably open only during organized events.

The old hangars on the western side of the airfield host the **Malta Aviation Museum**. It surprised me by being the first place I encountered in Malta which accepted only cash payments. But the exhibition did not disappoint. Inside are a number of aircraft, mostly military, representing all of the major types of machines that fought for the Allies during World War II. Once can also take a peek at the workshop where further models are being restored, and glance behind a curtain in the northern hangar to see more dusty aircraft awaiting their turn for restoration.

The museum has two extra neat touches: original buildings for a small staff canteen, and a tiny chapel for the airmen.

I saw more of the original, often round-roofed airfield buildings, present, and in use in the south-western part of the area. Some of them became part of the flashy **Crafts Village**, others are used as workshops and warehouses by the National Park's maintainers, and a few looked decrepit and abandoned.

All in all, the place was worth the visit, even though I was hoping that portions of the old airfield would be better exposed.

For a final surprise, the United States Embassy seems to be located right there, opposite from the National Park, occupying a sizable plot of land, and having moved there not long ago from Floriana. Who knows, maybe they enjoy the tranquility and solitude.
