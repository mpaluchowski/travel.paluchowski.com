"Hugely impressive Roman ruins" of a city and port "built to rival Alexandria", boasted the travel guide. You never know with ruins---many (most?) of them turn out to be a bunch of dull, loosely scattered stones. Caesarea was on our way back from [Haifa]({{< ref "/israel-2018/disappointment-thats-haifa.md" >}}), though, so we figured we might as well drop by and see.

We didn't time our arrival well. It was [the day of Yom Hazikaron]({{< ref "/israel-2018/proud-nation.md" >}}) and the amphitheater---perhaps the most interesting part---was closed early. The harbour was open though, and lucky for us, required no payment to enter.

The ruins were pretty much what we expected them to be. **Pieces of old building blocks, columns, scattered across the landscape.** Some still formed structures---walls, ponds, roads---others sat loosely on the ground, only vaguely reminding visitors of the once greatness of the city.

I must admit I fail to see the beauty of such places. Neither here, nor in Jerusalem. I do love old buildings---factories, castles, manors---as long as they're still roughly complete structures. For them I can imagine the buzz of life that they once hosted. But the ruins... I guess my imagination just isn't efficient enough to bridge the gap between stone piles and a bustling, ancient city.

Caesarea does have an upside, though. It's a picturesque location on the seashore---something local businesspeople discovered long ago, and opened up a few neat bars and restaurants, turning it into a **lovely spot for sunset dinners**. All of the restaurants face the waterfront, with both indoor and outside seating.

There are a few art galleries around, though these close considerably earlier than the restaurants. Plus, there's a diving school, where one can book underwater tours to see what else remains underneath the waters of the once busy Roman port.

All in all, it's not a place worth visiting on its own, but if you're on the way nearby and would like a nice meal in a pleasant location---particularly in the evening---it's certainly worth a detour.
