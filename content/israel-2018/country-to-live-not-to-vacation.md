Police car lights *always* blink here, no matter if they're on assignment or just crusing. Electrical two-wheelers rule the streets and sidewalks, from bikes to scooters. Cats are everywhere, but oddly no stray dogs. And the Tel Aviv climate in April feels lovely, damp and warm. All in all, how do we feel about the place?

If you're looking for a religious experience, the country has obvious appeal---whether you're Jewish, Christian or Muslim. There are throngs of pilgrims coming to Israel at all times of the year, mostly to Jerusalem, excited with walking in the steps of their prophets. Actually, we found many of our acquaintances *assumed* we were traveling for religious reasons when we told them of our plans to visit Israel.

On the other hand, if you're looking for historical and cultural sights, well, it's as with every place that's been a showcase to ancient events. There are ruins aplenty and they're what you expect them to be---stones all over the place, some scattered, some oranized. I know many people who still get excited with such settings, though personally we're not.

Israel is also not your typical middle-eastern place. There are neighborhoods with that kind of feel, like Jaffa, of narrow streets, cobblestone and sand-scorched stones. But most of what is today in the country was built in the last century, by incoming immigrants from Europe, who brought their own culture. This means, you won't see a lot of difference when coming from Europe. It's almost as if nobody lived here since the Roman times until late 19th century, which means you either have very old structures to look at or very modern ones.

The country's focus has obviously been quality of life (and security, more on that in a minute). I wrote about the conveniences of Tel Aviv earlier, with its beautiful beach, plentiful public spaces and lovely cuisine. Infrastructure is well maintained, streets are generally clean, public services are reliable. It's comfortable to live here and I can easily understand while people of Jewish heritage continue to move in here, especially while *to this day* they're facing discrimination elsewhere.

There are two downsides to living here, and both have to do with the country's status in the region. One is obviously the security aspect---there's always the possibility of a terrorist attack, mortar shells falling or an outright war. Israel has been very successful in defending itself ever since its founding, and they continue to stay on the ball. Security measures are clearly present, but were never particularly troublesome anywhere we went.

But Israel only has, somewhat weak, peace treaties with Jordan and Egypt, while it's all unstable to the north (and in all of Palestinian territories). This means one cannot just hop in their car and keep riding, like we could from Warsaw to Portugal, visiting friendly neighbors on the way. If you want to go anywhere, the only way is by airplane. Space to travel within the state is limited, not just because of the country's size, but also because a sizable portion of it is desert.

The second downside are the taxes. We've been told by numerous friends who had moved to Israel, that even for them it's expensive, partly because they pay lots of taxes on the wages they receive. Many cannot afford to live in Tel Aviv, while working there, and choose to live outside the city and commute. High taxes are probably there to fund the military, and to continue funding immigration of further Jews into the land. The more people the country has, the better it stands to defend itself and develop.

It is a country of optimism, though. It took a lot of optimism and courage to create it, then even more effort to defend its right to exist. Even if living here is not all roses, the people of Israel seem to be taking it in stries. They're happy to have a place of their own in the world and they're not shy celebrating it, at least annually.

Would we want to live here? Maybe, but not more so than in Europe. Will we visit again? If we had a good reason, perhaps an event of some sort, yes. For sightseeing we'll be heading elsewhere though. There are many more places to see in the world.
