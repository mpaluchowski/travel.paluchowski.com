We didn't quite know where to approach the Dead Sea. Our choice was limited to the southern end of the basin, since our car rental contract forbids us from going into Palestinian territory. The map showed only two localities---Ein Bokek and Ein Gedit. The later looked interesting due to the adjacent natural reserve, but it was an extra 30km of driving. We opted for Ein Bokek.

It's a weird place. Reminded me of Las Vegas---an unreal locality built in the middle of nowhere. Someone thought it's a good idea to put a bunch of hotels on the shore of what isn't even Dead Sea proper but evaporation pans used by Israeli industry. I'm guessing this makes their water even saltier than the northern parts.

Getting there requires driving through the desert, starting around Arad and along a continuous, steep drop of almost a kilometer vertically, down to nearly 500m *below* sea level. Along the road there are markers displaying the current terrain level every 100m or so. It's an impressive landscape of nothing but hills of sand and rocks around, with sparse scrubs here and there. Beautiful, and deadly, if one was to get stranded there.

It's scorching hot. Anywhere between 35 and 40C, rising as we moved closer to the sea. In Ein Bokek most people at the beach clustered underneath large (baldachims) to avoid direct sunlight. Nights are quite cold, we were told, which isn't suprrising in a desert, but we didn't stay long enough to check on our own.

The entrance to the beach sported an instructions table, advising visitors to never dive in the water and by all means not swallowing it. If anyone does, they need to see a doctor immediately. Uh, promising.

Otherwise, Ein Bokek is a sea resort like any other in the world. Surprisingly packed with people (where did all these people come from?) with *nothing* to do other than sit at the beach, stay in a hotel or roam the throngs of lousy shops and food stalls.

We didn't stay long. Dead Sea got checked off our list, we sat at the beach a bit, tried the water---yeah, it's fun to float in it, unless your skin happens to get irritated by it. Then we packed up and got on our way back to more a human-friendly environment.
