Hummus, mixed olives and red wine. That was my dinner on the first evening in Israel, and on pretty much every other evening I was there. Israeli cuisine is deeply rooted in the Middle Eastern tradition, but it's also so much more. Especially in Tel Aviv, where cultures mix and collide, bringing their tastes to the masses.

Falafel and hummus were the easiest and cheapest food to obtain. Everywhere we went, there were shops and stands offering these local dishes. Also the two grocery stores next to our apartment offered each a full fridge with different types of hummus.

Then there were the pitas and anything and everything could be packed into those---meats, veggies, as well as... hummus and falafel of course. Pitas seem to be what passes around here as bread. To get what we, Poles understand as bread, we had to go to our neighborhood Russian-run grocery store and get packaged bread with Russian inscriptions. We enjoyed both ways of adding carbs to meals, though admittedly pitas go much better with hummus and subjectively they feel more filling.

Big cities are melting pots of cultures, also of Jewish cultures from the different immigration waves that reached the young country over the last seventy years of its existence. One can easily eat Russian as well as Polish or German dishes. Asian cuisine, Thai, Chinese and the like, seems to be in short supply---somewhat in contrast to most western states.

There's also a whole wave of young culinary entrepreneurs experimenting with local and international cuisines, and these tend to have the most interesting offerings. They like to open modern bars in trendy neighborhoods, old ports turned leisure spaces, narrow streets of Jaffa and in the small houses of Neve Tsedek.

We were happy to find both vegetables and fruits were available in very good shape. This might've been the first time I ate a good watermelon this early in the year. We're always looking closely at the vegetables because, true to our Balkan tastes, we like to have our fresh salad some time in the day. And we had been deeply disappointed by the availability in warm climates in the past, particularly in Bali.

Wine's great. Red wine that is. We had one bottle of white, courtesy of our landlords, but this one was only so-so. It's the cooler countries that specializes in whites, particularly because they're too cold to grow proper red grapes. Israel is plenty hot for that and we had a few bottles of local wine, with grapes the names of which I couldn't possibly remember, which were all smooth, gentle and rich in taste.

Mainstream Israeli beer seems to be of the typical, southern, watery and light variety---again, what you'd expect in this climate. But there's also an interesting craft beer scene (like everywhere, I guess), which maintains the lightness to go with the climate, while offering a much broader variety of tastes and styles.

The only downside of Israeli food is that it's... so darn expensive. Actually, everything is expensive there, compared to prices in Poland. Take a price for anything in Warsaw, multiply it by two and that's the Israeli price. Heavy. The difference was even more tangible because the exchange rate of the Israeli Shekel to the Polish ZÅ‚oty is one-to-one, so the price tags there represented what we were being changed in our currency.

These prices meant that we had to rationalize our expenses on food, so on most days we had breakfasts and dinners at the apartment, while eating out for lunch. Groceries were still expensive, but less so than restaurants obviously. We saw the difference most vividly when, on the last day of our stay, we had burgers for two for lunch, with no drinks and a side of fries for one, then flew to Varna, Bulgaria and the same evening had a full dinner for four, with alcohol, for which we paid roughly the same amount.

Would we say we love Israeli cuisine? Not necessarily. It's just not distinct enough from modern Western nor traditional Middle Eastern offerings. Tasty as it is. We did like what we tasted, though, and all the culinary innovation, wine and craft beer movement are part of what makes the country, and the city of Tel Aviv in particular, so livable and enjoyable.
