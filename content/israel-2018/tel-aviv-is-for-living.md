<!--more-->

- port becoming a hipster place with all the restaurants open in the old docks and warehouses
- feels a lot older, messier than Tel Aviv
    - smaller houses, "ruin bars"
- beach
    - lots of bikers, runners
        - the "fit" city
    - early, not season yet, still a number of people tanning
    - all of Tel Aviv seems to be here on nice, free days
- Nezek Tsegev
- Carmel market
- excellent cuisine
- gay friendly bars
- very livable
- port a bit of a turn-off; marina more impressive elsewhere, ie. Mallorca
