Jerusalem is the first, and by far the longest chapter of the Lonely Planet Travel Guide to Israel. I could perhaps even risk stating, that it's the only place in Israel with worthy historical sights. As expected, it's chock full of tourists---most of them there for religious reasons, many grouped into pilgrimages, squeezing through the narrow streets of the Old City and chanting religious songs.

With tourists come all the inconveniences of tourism-oriented commerce. Random people on the street offering city tours, rides to Bethlehem (which we couldn't reach easily, because our car rental contract forbade us to go into Palestinian territory) and virtually all taxi drivers peddling their services---particularly heavily trying to convince anyone heading for Mt. Olive to not go there on foot, this being such a "steep and difficult climb".

There are so... many... shops... All the main streets of the Old City's Christian and Muslim quarters are filled with stalls selling symbols of every Abrahamic religion, sweets, juices, carvings, carpets and other crafts. It's not a particularly cozy atmosphere, but if you're OK with the crowds and some peddling from the shopkeepers, it makes for a helluva atmosphere. The other choice is using side streets, passing between residential houses (yes, people do live in the Old City), which are all but empty.

Interestingly, the Jewish quarter is much calmer. There are few shops and most of them rather elegant, plus a few places to eat. It's also the cleanest of the quarters, with most housing (re)built there in the late 60s and early 70s---visibly modern, but keeping the colors and style of the old construction. This is a recurring theme of Jerusalem, showing even in recent buildings, as the Mamilla Mall, just outside the Old City's walls, which looks almost indistinctly from the century-old walls adjacent to it.

Every major religion and its fraction seems to have their own spot(s) in the city---a tomb, a rock, a stone, a cave, related in some way to one of their religion's major representatives. Some of the religions quarrel even, which of them keeps watch over the *actual* place of some event, like the [check in Lonely Planet]. Needless to say, many of these spots seem to be connected to historical events by convention rather than confirmed historical facts. Most of them were "identified", and churches constructed around them, centuries ago, when obviously modern archeological methods were unavailable. And today, I imagine, nobody in their right mind would dare to question the faithfuls' beliefs.

We obviously visited the major spots in the city. The Western Wall was first on our route and it is... magical. There's a bit of security to enter it and then a whole lot of space, with seemingly few tourists and may Jews coming and going to pray at the only site in the world of Judaism, that has the status of a temple. An excellent spot for silent contemplation, though perhaps better visited on cooler days or in the evenings, this being a completely open area, it does get hot in the open sun.

Church of Holy Sepulchure was second and this, unsurprisingly, was full of pilgrims. These start off by kneeling and kising the stone, on which Jesus's body was supposedly laid after taking it off the cross. Then, deeper in the church, there's the grave of Jesus, with a long, long line of people wanting to get in for a minute or so, and be rushed out quickly to make room for others. We tried waiting in the line for a quarter of an hour and made barely any progress, so resigned. We did learn, though, that Kalvaria---the "mound" on which Jesus was crucified, wasn't a mountain at all. Just a rock, which Romans used for executions, which in those times was outside the city walls of Jerusalem. That rock is embedded into the church and a chapel is built around and on top of it.

Then there was the Temple Mound. Not easy to get in for us, non-Muslims, because we could only enter through a single gate, a security check and only at short times during the day. We managed. The inside is very pleasant indeed. We couldn't enter any of the buildings---the Al Aqsa mosque, nor the Dome of The Rock, this being some of the holiest places in Islam. But even the outside of the Dome of The Rock (the "rock" being the one from which Muhammad rose to heaven [check]), was a stunning piece of architecture and ornamentation.

The whole Temple Mound is spacious and, outside of prayer times, sparsely populated with Muslims and their families. Some come there to rest and have picnics. I was told that in Ramadan time the space hosts up to 120,000 people, and while we were there, preparations were already being made to receive them.

Finally, we checked out the Olive Mound, though we did stop short of climbing all the way to the top. What made a particular impression on us where the ancient, old olive trees. Some of them confirmed to be two millenia old, and as such, witnesses to the events described in the Bible and other scripture. We don't get to see a lot of living organisms that are this old. We tend to think of life as something, such as ours, that's rather short.

We did check out the New Town too, but that was rather unimpressive. It seemed to be frequented more by locals, and at nights had a large offer of bars, many advertising to the tourists and expats in the area.

Sadly, we missed out on two places which were away from the city center: the Yad Vashem institute and the much-hailed Museum of Israel. We had already made two trips to Jerusalem to cover the Old City, and didn't want to spend any more days of our Israel stay in transit. These two places will have to wait for another visit.

All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed Jerusalem. A friend of mine recommended that we stay there for at least a night, to get a feeling of the city, and its old parts in particular. I'm not convinced we would've liked that this much---we were very comfortable in Tel Aviv and consider that one a much more livable space. I read enough about the tensions between the Israelis and Palestinians as to the status of the city---both nations considering Jerusalem its capital---but during our visits on such tension seemed perceptible. Both nations lived next to each other, most people trying to make a decent living. Only the amount of Israeli soldiers on the streets---many more than anywhere else we saw in the country---hinted at the conflict.
