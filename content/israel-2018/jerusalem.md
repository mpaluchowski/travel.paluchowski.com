- first and longest chapter in the travel guide
- so... many... shops...
  - choice between crowded streets with shops or empty, secluded side streets
- people live there
  - Jewish quarter very elegant
  - new buildings keep the style of old, same colors, stones -- ie. shopping mall where we parked
- new town unimpressive
- Olive Mound
- every church has its own piece of the religious story
- Western Wall is magical
- Dome of the Rock is beautiful
- lots of soldiers everywhere
- pilgrimages
