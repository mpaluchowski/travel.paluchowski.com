"What's with all the flags?" Every bridge we passed, entering Tel Aviv, was decorated with a host of Israeli flags. As were many of the buildings and balconies we saw on the way. We arrived just in time for Yom Ha'atzmaut---the nation celebrating seventy years since their declaration of independence.

We didn't notice the holiday overlapping with our travel itinerary. I checked the religious ones to make sure we wouldn't be visiting the country when everything was shut closed, and other than on the Shabbat, we weren't expecting any impediments to our schedule. Finding out about Yom Ha'atzmaut was a surprise, albeit a pleasant one.

Israel celebrates their Independence Day on the anniversary of the May 14, 1948 declaration of independence---making this year's a round, 70th one. How come the celebration is in April? Because the holiday is scheduled based on the Hebrew calendar, with a moving date falling each year somewhere in April or May.

The day before Yom Ha'atzmaut starts is Yom Hazikaron---a remembrance of Israeli fallen soldiers and victims of terrorism. It started at sundown on Tuesday evening, around 19:00. All shops closed at that time---even the ones normally open on holidays and Shabbat. Then at 20:00 sirens sounded for a minute and the whole country came to a standstill. People stopped on the streets and stood at attention. Cars stopped on the streets, people stepped out of them. Then life resumed.

On Wednesday, at 11:00 there was a similar moment, this time with sirens sounding for two full minutes. We were on our way to Haifa at this point and stopped on the highway, as did pretty much everybody else around. It's amazing to see how widely and deeply this is being celebrated by the people of Israel. The country being rather small and its short (modern) history filled with considerable fighting, pretty much everyone here knows someone who was killed, either in battle or in a terrorist attack. This makes Yom Hazikaron not just a national holiday, but also a very personal one.

At sunset on Wednesday Yom Ha'atzmaut begins and sadness turns into intense joy of celebrating the state's existence. Israeli flags are everywhere. On bridges, balconies and gates. Cars have their side mirrors covered with flags, or poles stuck onto doors. People wear them over their shoulders walking around the city and---my personal favorite---children carry huge inflatable hammers, axes, pitchforks and other "weapons" decorated with Israeli flag colors and emblems, fighting with their peers along the way.

We went to Rabbit Square to see the city's official celebrations. All along the way bars and clubs were open, throwing independence day parties. Weather was delightful---a warm evening like the warmest summer ones we get to have in Poland. Entering Rabbin Sq. required passing a bit of security and in we were, surrounded by throngs of people, mostly whole families, with children grown and small.

Kids' top activity was covering everything and everyone in some special foam that they were spraying from an abundance of cans. I'd love to find out the symbolic of that---if there is any.

The official program at Rabbit Sq. included a number of performances, from modern to more traditional, to short films displaying images from the country's 20th century wars. Most people though seemed just to enjoy being there. The atmosphere was more of a picnic, with some bars around the square packed and spilling into the streets. Lawns covered with families sitting and eating. Many just strolling around the vicinity, enjoying their time spent together in a festive manner.

Parties were thrown across town, in pretty much every club and sometimes on the streets. Vans were rolling with massive speakers blasting music for the groups dancing around them. We didn't get a good sleep that night, but we fully appreciated the joy of our hosts.

It was exciting and exhilarating to be there. A nation that celebrates their independence with earnest joy and not a hint (as far as we could tell) of hatred towards anyone else. I almost felt like the celebration was my own too, like it was my country. Such a difference from the hostile Independence Day "festivities" back home in Poland.
