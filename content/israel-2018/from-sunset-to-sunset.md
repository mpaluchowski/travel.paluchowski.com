"We close today at seven", said the shop clerk on the eve of [Yom Hazikaron]({{< ref "israel-2018/proud-nation.md" >}}). Most of the shops and restaurants did likewise, with 19:00 being roughly the time of sunset at this time of year. Israel lives on a curious schedule, counting many of its days from sunset to sunset.

[The Shabbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat) is perhaps the best known example of the schedule. It begins at sundown on Friday, followed by twenty four hours during which religious Jews must abstain from any and all work, and finishes at sundown on Saturday. (Fun fact: the metal detectors at the Western Wall in Jerusalem were officially "Shabbat certified", meaning crossing them to pray at the Wall did *not* violate the Shabbat.)

During the whole Shabbat public transportation in Tel Aviv was reduced to a subset of irregularly driving minivans, instead of the regular throng of buses. I was on the balcony of our apartment on Saturday evening, reading, when I noticed regular buses back on the streets. Realizing it was past sunset, I had this feeling of the world going back to normal. While observation of the Shabbat isn't particularly strict in Tel Aviv, it's still a much quieter day than any other, and it feels bizarre.

Yom Hazikaron and Yom Ha'atzmaut were celebrated all the same. The former started on Tuesday evening, with many celebrations throughout the twenty four hours that followed. Then Wednesday evening Yom Ha'atzmaut began, around 19:00 and soon afterwards, shortly before 21:00 a number of parties across the city started, celebrating the state's 70-year anniversary of independence.

The week isn't quite aligned like we're used to in the western world either. Fridays and Saturdays are off (with some companies working Fridays until noon or so), while Sundays are regular working days. Though with many people living here *not* being hardcore religious, this isn't universally the case. Some restaurants or shops take Sundays or Mondays off.

The reason I find this schedule exotic is probably just me being a regular, payroll, nine-to-five employee with a standard working schedule. There are plenty of people working on different schedules (ie. shops, restaurants, public services) or without a set schedule at all (freelancers, remote workers). After all, any weekday is the same as any other, and every hour is similar, unless we decide that it's meaningful in some way. The Jews and Israelis have simply a different alignment of meaning.
