"We close today at seven", said the shop clerk on the eve of [Yom Hazikaron]({{< ref "israel-2018/proud-nation.md" >}}). Most of the shops and restaurants did likewise, with 19:00 being roughly the time of sunset at this time of year. Israel lives on a curious schedule, counting many of its days from sunset to sunset.
