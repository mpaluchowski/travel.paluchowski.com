- surprisingly little security at the airport
    - just the two persons at the aircraft
    - seen way more in Brussels and London
    - quick questions at car entry and before check-in
        - hello, how are you, where have you been
    - nothing else beyond standard airport security, no soldiers, assault weapons etc.
- guy handling delivery at shop had a gun behind belt,
    - people in the streets often have pistols; walking with families, unpacking shop delivery
    - guy with pistol in Jerusalem
- lots of soldiers in Jerusalem
    - primarily in the Muslim quarter of the old town
- quite a few people everywhere in uniforms, some of them carrying backpacks and long weapons
    - interesting sight of soldier(s) sitting in cafes, armed, drinking and chatting
