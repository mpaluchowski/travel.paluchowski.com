Terrorist attacks, bombings and wars are, sadly, as connected to the image of Israel, as the sights of the Western Wall and other sacred places. Our families were mildly concerned before our travel, urging us to stay safe and out of trouble. But was it warranted? For the most part, we felt very safe and saw less visible security than elsewhere.

I expected the Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv to be heabily guarded, since it's the main gateway to and from Israel and the most natural spot to wreak havoc in a terrorist attack. Surprisingly, there's very little visible security there. On arrival two easy-looking security guards watched over us as we were leaving the airplane. Then there were a few officers around the exit from the baggage claim, occasionally screening some passengers and that was that. Some uniformed guards were strolling the terminal here and there, but were barely noticeable.

There's a bit more security when departing. Driving towards the airport we passed through a quick security check, where a guard simply greeted us and asked a few simple questions, like where we stayed in Israel or where we've been to. It's not about the answers but about judging whether we behave nervously.

Then there's more questioning just before the check-in desks, where we've been asked whether we packed our luggage ourselves or whether we're carrying anything for anyone. Again, we're being judged less on the answers and more on how we behave here.

That's that. Overall, across the area of the airport there were uniformed guards patrolling or standing at entrances and exists, but all were very lightly armed and looked nothing like the heavy-duty soldiers I saw at various airports in Europe, notably in Belgium, with long assault guns, bullet-proof vests.

All this heavy security guns everywhere type of setup is what security experts call "security theater", which is more meant to show a display of care for safety rather than make anything really safe. What the Israelis do is actual security---trying to prevent acts of terrorism long before they really happen and far away from their targets.

They place selective security checks outside of key areas, like at Ben Gurion gates above, and similarly at the gates of Ein Bokek, where as we drove in, a guard stopped us and simply asked "hi, how are you today?"

Yom Ha'atzamaut, Israel's 70th anniversary of independence, would've been a prime opportunity for terrorists to disrupt. The official celebrations we joined at Rabin square were secured by cutting off the square from any incoming traffic by blocking incoming streets with large tour buses. Pedestrians could pass with ease, but cars were obviously unable to enter, or to ram their way into the area. Additionally, there was a very brief baggage check at the entrance to the square and a bit of armed police on the edges of the square itself.

Jerusalem was another story. Here the military was omnipresent, noticeable in pretty much every area of the city we've been to, but notably in the Muslim district of the Old City. With the city being perhaps the most disputed strip of land in the whole region, it's easy to understand why security might be most crucial right here.

Not all of the soldiers we've seen were on active duty. Many of them seemed off duty, or moving between points. Still, they always carried their assault weapons with them, often sitting in cafes with friends, sipping drinks, eating and sporting large weapons on their laps. An interesting sight that'd probably make many unaccustomed people uncomfortable, although strangely, I didn't feel in any way discomforted by that.

Many civilians carry weapons too. Often in the open. One of the guys unpacking a delivery at the local store we were frequenting, had a pistol behind his belt. Another guy was strolling Jerusalem with his family and kids, also openly carrying a pistol. I guess many more people had a gun with them, we just didn't see those. Apparently there's about [1 gun licensed for every 30 people in Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-dismisses-us-gun-lobbys-inaccurate-claim-about-gun-laws/), which is a lot, but still notably less than in the USA.

So, if you're wondering whether Israel is a safe place to visit, we'd say it is. Incidents these days seem to be few and far between. The country has perfected it's security measures, plus they somewhat calmed their relationships with groups and communities that caused the most trouble in the recent decades. Security measures are noticeable across the country, but far less so than we were expecting, and even less than we saw in places considered much safer, like in Belgium. Just make sure you're comfortable with the sight of light and heavy weapons carried around in the open frequently by people with and without uniforms.
