<!--more-->

- altogether disappointing
- built on a mountain slope, an nightmare to walk
- Baha'i Gardens gorgeous but closed unless with a tour, limited a day
- tech cluster in the south, with all the big companies
    - tech campus like any other office complex anywhere in the world
- doesn't look like a livable city
- downtown unattractive, run down shops and cafes
    - no real center, aside from downtown, which is one street that's somewhat cleaner than the others
